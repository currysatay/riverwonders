<h2 style="text-align:center;">Spot these animals.</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">Be enthralled by the sights and sounds of animals hailing from one of the most diverse rainforest habitats in the world!</p>

<img src="Brazilian Tapir.jpg" alt="Brazilian Tapir">width="550" height"350"
<h2>Brazilian Tapir</h2>
<p>Almost always found near water, this species of tapir is fast on land – and even faster in the water. Its multipurpose snout doubles up as a snorkel, helping the animal to stay submerged for hours.</p>

<h2>Jaguar</h2>
<p>In Amazon River Quest, be transported into a dark cave where you’ll get to encounter a spotted predator in the form of the jaguar. This stealthy cat is an excellent swimmer and is perfectly capable of carrying large prey even while swimming.</p>

<img src="Anteater.jpg" alt="Anteater">width="550" height"350"
<h2>Giant Anteater</h2>
<p>With its distinct narrow head, bushy tail and long snout, it's almost impossible to miss the giant anteater. As it shuffles around searching for food, the giant anteater uses its long and narrow tongue to lap up ants and termites from ant mounds.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Considerations</h2>
<p style="text-align:center:">Height restrictions: Children who are 1.06m and taller are welcome to embark on Amazon River Quest. A child swap procedure is in place such that a supervising adult and the child can wait while the others go on the boat ride. The supervising adult can board the boat once the others return. </p>
<p style="text-align:center:">Weather: Rain’s no fun. For this reason, we may suspend Amazon River Quest if the weather affects our visitors’ safety and comfort. Please note that ride tickets will not be replaced in the event of ride suspensions, and admission tickets sold can’t be refunded.</p>
