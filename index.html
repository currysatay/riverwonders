  <h2>River Wonders</h2>
  <h3>Asia's first and only river-themed wildlife park</h3>
  <img src="River Wonders.jpg" alt="River Wonders"> width"550" height"350">

  <p>Located within Mandai Wildlife Reserve, River Wonders is home to one of the world’s largest collections of freshwater vertebrates, with over 11,000 animal specimens representing close to 260 species as well as 400 plant species. The park highlights the wonders of tropical freshwater ecosystems and the need to protect them.</p>
  <p>Through immersive wildlife encounters and a relaxing experience, River Wonders hopes to inspire a sense of awe at the variety of freshwater life, restore visitors’ connections to the natural world and empower them to protect freshwater habitats and the wildlife dependent on them.</p>
  <p>Visitors can learn about iconic river giants like the highly threatened Mekong giant catfish and giant freshwater stingray, giant arapaimas, green anaconda and Antillean manatees. The park is also home to giant pandas.</p>
  <p>With a focus on sustainable operations, River Wonders is the first attraction in Singapore to be conferred with the Building and Construction Authority’s Green Mark Platinum Award in the park category.</p>
  <p>River Wonders is managed by Mandai Wildlife Group and is accredited by two top international regional zoo associations—European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), and Zoo and Aquarium Association of Australasia (ZAA). It is also a member of the Southeast Asian Zoo and Aquarium Association (SEAZA) and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA).</p>
  
  <h4>How it's designed</h4>
  <p>Most of our river-themed wildlife park can be explored on foot. Guests will meander through the park on an exploratory river adventure of the Congo, Nile, Ganges, Mekong and Yangtze rivers, peering into our freshwater aquariums and luscious walk-through exhibits.</p>
  <p>Here is a virtual tour of River Wonders.</p>
